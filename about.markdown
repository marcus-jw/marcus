I am Marcus Williams, an AI Alignment Engineer and Research Scholar at MATS. My work focuses on improving the safety and reliability of AI systems, with a particular emphasis on reinforcement learning and language models.

My research interests include:
- Multi-objective reinforcement learning
- AI safety and alignment
- Expressivity of RL formalisms
- Targeted manipulation and deception in language models

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss AI safety, my research, or potential collaborations.
